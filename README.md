# RL (RealLive) Scripting Extension
This extension adds syntax highlighting to '.org' and '.utf' files used by the RealLive Visual Novel Engine! This extension strives to make it easier (especially for me) to read scripts for RealLive.

# 0.1
Currently, all functions contained in the Tomoyo After (RL 1.6) game are currently implemented. I believe i'm currently missing choice functions, and other special stuff in other games. (CLANNAD probably contains some...)
